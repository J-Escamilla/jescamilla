Hello! This is my first go at my portfolio. As of right now 7/13/2021, it's not quite finished. I have to update some information, add a resume, and more importantly, the projects. 
It's far from perfect, and I'm not designer, but being only 3/4 months into this journey, I can't be mad at it. Anyways, feel free to look around and give some feedback and
suggestions! 


For the time being, ignore the JavaScript file. I'm still learning and haven't added the feature I wanted to yet. 

ALSO! I don't know Vue or Tailwind quite yet. Those are there merely as placeholders because that's what I'm going to be learning soon.
I'll also add WordPress pretty soon as well.
