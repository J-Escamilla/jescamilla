Hello! This is my first go at my portfolio. As of right now 7/13/2021, it's not quite finished. I have to update some information, add a resume, and more importantly, the projects. 
It's far from perfect, and I'm not designer, but being only 3/4 months into this journey, I can't be mad at it. Anyways, feel free to look around and give some feedback and
suggestions!
